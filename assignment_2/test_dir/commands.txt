sudo -u \#0 mkdir test_dir (owner and group is root)
sudo chmod +t test_dir
cd test_dir
vi test_1 (owner and group is niramay)
sudo -u \#1001 vi test_2 (owner and group is temp)
sudo -u \#1002 vi test_3 (onwer and group is test)

by doing this, every user can read other's files but can't write to them
any user can create a file and only a file's owner can delete that file, no-one else

how does setting sticky bit for the test_dir and making it's owner and group as root help?
used on directories, indicates that in order to rename or delete a file in that directory a user must both have write permissions to the directory and one of the following must be true-
user owns the file/user owns the directory/user is the superuser
when sticky bit is set, only the owner of a file/directory can delete
